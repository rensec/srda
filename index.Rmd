# About {.unnumbered}

This page contains tutorials for the Utrecht University course "Social Research in the Digital Age".

## Usage {.unnumbered}

To use these tutorials, we suggest that you:

-   Open a new R script;
-   Copy-paste the code from the tutorials into your R script as you read along;
-   Run the code from your script while reading along, to verify that your results are the same;
-   Afterwards, save your R script under an informative name so that you can refer to it and reuse it later. A big part of effective data analysis is realizing that you've solved particular problems before and being able to find and recycle your earlier code!

<!-- If you need PDF output, uncomment bookdown::pdf_book above in YAML. You will need a LaTeX installation, e.g., https://yihui.name/tinytex/ -->
